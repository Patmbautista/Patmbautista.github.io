Everyday there is new data that is being produced which leads to opportunities for new discoveries. I’ve been exposed to data science in different ways since college before I knew there was such a field.

What makes Data Science interesting to me is that it isn’t anchored to only one type of work. It is essentially an umbrella where a plethora of skills fall under. Data Science is AI, machine learning,  it’s predictive modeling, analyzing, it’s statistics, coding and the list goes on. I decided to pursue data science because I wanted to expand my skill set and work with businesses in delivering solutions and insight. I’m excited to embark in this journey and be challenged to unravel my potential and what I can bring into the future of tech.
